Text sitemap
============

Creates a list of URLs to pages in a Backdrop site for indexing by search engines.

Text sitemaps are [supported by Google Webmaster Tools](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/183668?hl=en).

If you use this module, and want to override listing a specific node, you could use robots.txt to make an exclusion or unpublish it.

The original port of this was based on code that was written before Views existed. It might be neat to make the next major version release based on a Views query instead of the custom code in this module.
